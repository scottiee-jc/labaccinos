# Java Polymorphism Exercises
We've learned about polymorphism in class, now put that knowledge to use!

## 1. Please create a new project, with multiple classes
Use your own concept - don't simply duplicate the examples used in the lessons, or on the textbook

## 2. Create an abstract class
Your example doesn't have to be real-world, but it should have at least some internal logic to it

## 3. Extend the abstract class with at least 2 sub-classes

## 4. Create a collection which accepts objects of either of those 2 types

## 5. Implement at least 1 method overload

## 6: Create your own enum to represent a set of constants
Use the enum in a way that makes sense within the logic of your example

## 7 Create an interface and implement it on at least 1 class
Also, use the interface you create as the type of a variable somewhere in your project. New up an object from a class that implements the interface.
